# Contributing to Zephir

Zephir is an open source project and a volunteer effort. Zephir welcomes
contribution from everyone. The following summarizes the process for
contributing changes. Please take a moment to review this document in order
to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Community

Zephir is maintained and supported by [Phalcon Team][team] and developed in
collaboration with a productive community of contributors. Please use the
[GitHub issues][issues] to raise discussion of development topics.

We use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests and have
limited bandwidth to address all of them. Thus we only accept bug reports,
new feature requests and pull requests in GitHub. Our great community and
contributors are happy to help you though! Please use these community
resources for obtaining help.

_Please use the [Documentation][docs] before anything else. You can also use
the search feature in our documents to find what you are looking for. If your
question is still not answered, there are more options below._

## Contributions

Contributions to Zephir should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests.
Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with
permission to merge patches). Feedback can be provided and potentially changes
requested or the pull request will be merged. All contributions should follow
this format, even those from core contributors.

## C++ language standard

This project uses C++17 language standard.
